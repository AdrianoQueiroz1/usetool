USE is a system for the specification of information systems. It is
based on a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). A USE
specification contains a textual description of a model using features
found in UML class diagrams (classes, associations, etc.). Expressions
written in the Object Constraint Language (OCL) are used to specify
additional integrity constraints on the model. A model can be animated
to validate the specification against non-formal requirements. System
states (snapshots of a running system) can be created and manipulated
during an animation. For each snapshot the OCL constraints are
automatically checked. Information about a system state is given by
graphical views.  OCL expressions can be entered and evaluated to
query detailed information about a system state.
