$Bug: Navigation in ternary association fails (wrong result type).$

Problem: If you have a use model like the following

  class A
  end

  class B
  end

association R between
  A[0..1] role r1
  A[0..1] role r2
  B[*] role r3
end

and a system state

  !create A1:A
  !create A2:A
  !create A3:A
  !create B:B
  !insert (A1,A2,B) into R
  !insert (A2,A3,B) into R

and then try to evaluate the following 

  ?B.r1

you get an error "expected link set size 1 at association end `start', found: 2"
But you should get Set{A1,A2}!
