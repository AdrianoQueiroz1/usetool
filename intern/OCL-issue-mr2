Subject: Missing inequality operator for collections

Description:

There is no inequality operator "<>" for the collection types Set,
Sequence, and Bag. They only define "=".

Proposed change:

Add an "<>" operator to Set, Sequence, and Bag as follows.

set<>(set2 : Set(T)) : Boolean
  post: not (set = set2)

bag<>(bag2 : Bag(T)) : Boolean
  post: not (bag = bag2)

sequence<>(sequence2 : Sequence(T)) : Boolean
  post: not (sequence = sequence2)
