Number of context variables
---------------------------

The OCL grammar only allows at most one variable in a
classifierContext.  There seems to be no reason why this could not be
generalized to allow more than one variable. The example on p. 7-18
(which is frequently needed in similar forms) could then be just
written as:

context p1, p2 : Person inv:
  p1 <> p2 implies p1.name <> p2.name
