Reason for this error (gutsche): 

The barchart is drawen with java.awt. components and those components
are heavy weight components. Everything else in the ObjectCountView
and the sourounding are javax.swing. components. Swing however are
leight weight components. This gives the resulting distraction in the
view discriped below.

Suggestion: 
Replacing the BarChartView with a table in which we add bars as an
images in a corresponding size.


Error description (green):

If the ObjectCount window countains more lines than the screen can
display, the view is distorted in the lower part of the view.
