Diagram elements can register themselves as event listeners on other
elements. For example, when a class symbol is moved, all attached
associations should update their paths. Likewise, GUI components
listen on change events triggered by diagram symbols. Moving a class
symbol results in the following event chain:

component.move 
  -> class diagram symbol.move 
    -> notify component about new position 
      -> component redraw 
    -> notify all attached associations
      -> associations move 
      -> notify association components
        -> component redraw
