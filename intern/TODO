- collection expressions for insert, delete, or general loop construct? 
  add example for Cartesian product of links
- fix mouse handling in views (for jdk1.4)
- GUI: playback of command files, forward, backward, timed animation
- update prepost.html
- new views: variable bindings
- overloading of operations (need resolution rules)
- user-defined operations with non-identifier names such as <,=,+,etc.
- add data types like Date
- GUI: object diagram: insert link: include inherited associations
- bug fix: shorthand for 0..1 sets does not work with -><iterate-expr> ?!
- MMInstanceGenerator: generate operations
- add Tuple type
- association classes


+ allow expressions in !commands
+ check other commands for OCL expressions
+ grammar: arbitrary order of classes, associations, constraints
+ OCL let-expressions
+ use greatest common supertype of elements in collection literals
+ new views: opcall stack
+ add oclIsNew
+ add OCL pre- and postconditions
+ grammar: inconsistent semicolon rules for attributes and constraints section 
  (made semicolons optional) 
+ grammar: allow query expressions without element variable
  and implicit self in grammar (see bug0009)
  - changed grammar to use propertyCall
  - Removed ASTIdExpression, use only ASTOperationExpression
  - add stack for default context expression in class Context
+ invariant names local to class scope
+ implement "any", "one" (OCL 1.4)
+ GUI solution for check -d: list of "good" instances and list of "bad" instances
+ add isUnique operation
+ new nodes in object diagrams are all positioned at 0,0
+ button in EvalOCLDialog: Clear result
+ bug0010
+ check actionsemantics-mm
+ enforce Classifier3 invariant in USE models
+ generate vcg graph for class diagrams
+ OCL shorthand notation (also add flag to disable)
+ shorthand for 0..1 association ends: rolename->isEmpty()
+ production of evalnodes requires lots of memory, make optional
+ check structure: n-ary links
+ shortcut evaluation of boolean expressions

fix: also offer inherited associations for inerting links
statusline: hint for popup-menu on object diagram
delete object
remove link
+ add www docs to dist
