You've probably already noticed this, but with USE 2.0.1 I always get a java.lang.Class\
CastException if I use the ->sum operation on a collection containing Integer and Real \
numbers. For example, Set{1.2, 3, 3.2, 5}->sum causes this exception. Jolly annoying in\
 inspections!

While I've got your attention, having only just started using USE for real projects I h\
ave a few questions for you that aren't covered in the documentation:

1. How can declare and use a classifier-scope operation or attribute in a .use specific\
ation?
2. How do I declare a derived attribute or association?
3. How do I insert a collection of objects into an association end with * multiplicity \
(rather than doing it one object at a time)?

If you get a free moment please see if you can fill me in.

Many thanks
