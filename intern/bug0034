$Bug: GUI exit leaves command line interface running$

Using File->Exit or closing the main window leaves the command line
shell open.



Problem: The command shell is waiting for a line. Calling
System.exit() leaves shell unusable under Linux/GNUReadline.

Fix: Added InterruptableGNUReadline class which can be interrupted
from outside and restores shell state. Uses deprecated Thread.stop,
though.
