$Bug: GUI exit leaves command line interface running$

DESCRIPTION:
  
  Using File->Exit or closing the main window leaves the command line
  shell open.

  Problem: The command shell is waiting for a line. Calling
  System.exit() leaves shell unusable under Linux/GNUReadline.

SOLUTION: 
  
  Added InterruptableGNUReadline class which can be interrupted
  from outside and restores shell state. Uses deprecated Thread.stop,
  though.
