dear fernando,

i remember you and our lunch time chat very well. thanks again for your
interest in our work.

the 'treated' version of the uml metamodel can be found at:

   ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-bremen.de/local/db/papers/uml2004/

i say 'treated', because in many cases it was not clear to us how to
correct the bugs. 

if you are interested in the new version of the USE tool, you can find
our current developer version in the same directory. among other new
stuff, it includes a snapshot generator (see our uml2003 paper). we are
planning to put a release on the web very soon. any feedback is welcome!

best regards
martin

Dear Martin,

Thanks a lot for your feedback to my request. We will try your improved
version of the USE tool indeed. Regarding the ocl_uml2.use file, it has a
minor bug:

use> open ocl_uml2.use
ocl_uml2.use:4871:2: expecting EOF, found 'context'

Although the failure message is not very instructive, I found this bug is
due to an empty context clause. By just commenting it the problem goes away:
-- page 238 (Acrobat Reader page 254)
-- context IntermediateActions_LinkEndCreationData

Hope this minor bug report helps for a future release  :) 

Best regards

Fernando
