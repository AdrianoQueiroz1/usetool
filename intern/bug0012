Hello,

we have noticed the presence of 2 associations :
AssociationRole_AssociationEndRole
AssociationEndRole_ClassifierRole
which seems to be unnecessary.
In UML metamodel these associations mention roles with names starting
with /.
They are in fact derived roles that must be computed from the inherited
association.
So the 2 previous associations must be replaced by operations computing
the roles.

I e-mail you a problem occur when i show result of invariant in Class
Extend.
We have tried Use 1.5.0 under Unix and Java 1.3 and the problem doesn't
occur.
My version of Java under NT was 1.2.2.
So perhaps ...
