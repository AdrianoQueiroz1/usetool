- assign create -> Seq. diagr. (Fehler) beheben
- repair all bugs (about 40)
- list all developers participating in the USE system or USE modules
- list all new features available through diploma/master thesis, projects etc.
- decide which features are appropriate for USE and should be included, which features have to be improved and which can be disregarded
- provide for further UML and OCL features (e.g. aggregation and composition (semantically), ordered sets, qualifier)
- integrate the snapshot generator in the GUI***
- provide for (generic) standard procedures (for the generator) applicable for every model (for example to create an example objectdiagram)
- evaluation over more then two model levels (M0,M1,M2)
- modify the GUI
- XMI import / export
- make the OCL evaluation view more comfortable
- prepare USE documentation v 1.0
- correct evaluation results of some Standard OCL Operations
- usable result value of user defined operations
- empty model at system start
- Klassenfeatures in Ergänzung zu Objektdeatures

*** Snapshot Generator:
- allow meta expressions like "inv1 implies inv2"
- develop snapshot generator view
- develop a mechanism for specifying a set of system states, which fulfill particular properties
- make the checking of meta expressions in context of a set of system states possible (the generator has to create the snapshots fulfilling the specified properties)
- ...
