To add a bug description, simple create a new intern/bugxxxx file
(chose the next free number for xxxx). 
You may include the following tags somewhere in your file:

$Bug: my bugdescription$
$Author: green $
$State: the state of the bug (Open, Closed, Pending, ... )$
$Tests: tests that cover this bugs (e.g. in test/ or unit tests)$

You can use the mainentance target 'buglist-fb3' to generate and
update the buglist on the fb3 website.
