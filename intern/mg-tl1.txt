Structural problems:

- State is abstract. NormalMode, BlinkMode should be SimpleStates.

- A StateMachine requires a top state which is a CompositeState. The
  top state has NormalMode and BlinkMode as components.

- The association between TrafficLight and StateMachine is wrong:
  should be the one in Fig. 2-21 between ModelElement and
  StateMachine.

Failed invariants:

- Class1: [1] If a Class is concrete, all the Operations of the Class
  should have a realizing Method in the full descriptor.
